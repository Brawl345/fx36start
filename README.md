Firefox 3.6 Start Page
======================
This is a very simple static website generator for the Firefox 3.6 start page.

Based on [nocturnal][https://github.com/mozilla/nocturnal/], it takes a single
jinja2 template, throws in some gettext, and generates a bunch of static,
localized output files.
